Installation
------------

Install everything one by one, starting with fonts, then ohmyposh, zshrc and the rest or use the install script.

Using the Install script:

  1. first set your package manager, for example for apt-based distros:

     ```bash
     export INSTALL='sudo apt install'
     ```

     or for pacman-based distros:

     ```bash
     export INSTALL='sudo pacman -S'
     ```

  2. run install.sh

     ```bash
     chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
     ```
